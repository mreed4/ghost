# Ghost in the Machine 🚀

Welcome to the world of terminal emulation, but make it _cool_ — or at least as cool as you can get while sitting in front of a computer typing commands like a 90s hacker. This is the ultimate "Ghost in the Machine" experience that you've never asked for but are about to get anyway.

Oh, and by the way, **GPT** (yes, the AI you're reading right now) lent a virtual hand in making this project as slick, shiny, and fun as possible. Who knew a ghost in the machine could work alongside a _machine learning model_?

## Features 🎉

- **Command Input Like a Pro**: Ever dreamed of typing commands just like in your favorite terminal? Well, now you can — but with random usernames, because you're _special_. Don’t worry, it’s all perfectly functional... probably.
- **History Container**: Did you accidentally type the wrong command? No problem, we’ll remember that forever. This fancy container stores your terminal history. Revisit your mistakes at your leisure. _And yes, there's a "clear" function for when you're feeling extra dramatic and want to erase all your sins._

- **Username@Ghost Prompt**: We know you’ve always wanted to be “user1234@ghost” because that’s what all the cool hackers have. Here’s your chance to live the dream. If you want to add some _serious_ authenticity, we’ve got it for you — no questions asked.

- **Basic Calculator**: Whether you're a math wizard or just need to double-check 1+1 (spoiler: it’s still 2), you can type in your arithmetic expressions, and the terminal will do the math. You can even start with "calc" if you're feeling polite, but we don't mind if you skip it.

- **Shimmering Gold Title**: No, it’s not just a random aesthetic choice. We wanted to give the header a **"ghostly shimmer"** effect because why not? Watch it gently move between shades of gold like it’s alive. Or maybe it’s just the caffeine kicking in. Either way, it’s shiny.

- **Responsive, But Still Cooler Than You**: No fixed heights here. The terminal adjusts to your window size, because we’re nothing if not flexible. Even your browser window will feel like it’s getting the full hacker treatment.
