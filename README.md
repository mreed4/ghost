# Ghost in the Machine 🚀

Welcome to the world of terminal emulation, but make it _cool_ — or at least as cool as you can get while sitting in front of a computer typing commands like a 90s hacker. This is the ultimate "Ghost in the Machine" experience that you've never asked for but are about to get anyway.

## Features 🎉

- **Command Input Like a Pro**: Ever dreamed of typing commands just like in your favorite terminal? Well, now you can — but with random usernames, because you're _special_. Don’t worry, it’s all perfectly functional... probably.
- **History Container**: Did you accidentally type the wrong command? No problem, we’ll remember that forever. This fancy container stores your terminal history. Revisit your mistakes at your leisure. _And yes, there's a "clear" function for when you're feeling extra dramatic and want to erase all your sins._

- **Username@Ghost Prompt**: We know you’ve always wanted to be “user1234@ghost” because that’s what all the cool hackers have. Here’s your chance to live the dream. If you want to add some _serious_ authenticity, we’ve got it for you — no questions asked.

- **Shimmering Gold Title**: No, it’s not just a random aesthetic choice. We wanted to give the header a **"ghostly shimmer"** effect because why not? Watch it gently move between shades of gold like it’s alive. Or maybe it’s just the caffeine kicking in. Either way, it’s shiny.

- **Keypress Glow**: Because every time you hit a key, you deserve a glow-up. The title glows in a _subtle_ manner when you press any key. Don’t get too excited, it’s not a disco ball, just a gentle reminder that you’re typing.

- **Responsive, But Still Cooler Than You**: No fixed heights here. The terminal adjusts to your window size, because we’re nothing if not flexible. Even your browser window will feel like it’s getting the full hacker treatment.
